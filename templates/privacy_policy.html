                <p><strong>Effective Date: November 7, 2025</strong></p>
                
                <p>Welcome to home.azuriki.com. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we manage and why.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">1. Information We Collect</h3>
                
                <p>We have two different levels of information collection based on how you use our site.</p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">For All Anonymous Visitors:</h5>
                <p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from visitors who are simply browsing our website. Our web server may log anonymous data for statistical purposes (such as your browser type or the time of your visit), but this information cannot be used to identify you.</p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">For Our Registered Users:</h5>
                <p>This website does not have a public, self-service registration form. We (the site administrators) manually create accounts for our users to grant them access to the home control feature.</p>
                
                <p>To create your account, we collect and store the following personally identifiable information (PII) that you provide to us directly:</p>

                    <li>Your Phone Number</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
                
                <p>We use the PII collected from our registered users only for the following specific purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To create, manage, and secure your user account.</li>
                    <li>To provide you with access to our home control feature.</li>
                    <li>To communicate with you about your account or our services. This may include contacting you via the email address or phone number you provided.</li>
                    <li>To respond to your direct inquiries.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">3. We Do Not Sell Your Information</h3>
                
                <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to any third parties for any reason.</p>
                
                <p>We will only disclose your information if required to do so by law (e.g., in response to a court order).</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">4. Cookies and Third-Party Services</h3>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Essential Cookies:</h5>
                <p>If you are a registered user, we use essential cookies (small files stored on your device) to manage your login session and verify your identity when you are signed in. These cookies are necessary for the restricted areas of the website to function.</p>
                
                <h5 class="mt-3">Analytics:</h5>
                <p>We use third-party services, such as Google Analytics, to understand how visitors interact with our site. These services use cookies to collect anonymous, non-personal data (like pages visited and time on site). This data helps us improve our website, but it does not include your personal information and cannot be used to identify you.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">5. Data Security</h3>
                
                <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect the personal information we store from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access.</p>
                
                <h3 class="mt-4">6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
                
                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically to stay informed.</p>
