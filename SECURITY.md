# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security features implemented in the Garage Web App MySQL authentication system.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Configuration
- **No hardcoded secrets**: All sensitive data is stored in environment variables
- **`.env` file exclusion**: The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- **Example configuration**: `.env.example` provides template with placeholders

### 2. Database Security
- **Parameterized queries**: All database queries use parameterized statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Limited database privileges**: Recommended to use a dedicated database user with minimal required permissions
- **SSL/TLS support**: Optional encrypted connections to the MySQL database
- **Connection validation**: Database connections are validated before use

### 3. Password Security
- **Secure hashing**: Passwords are hashed using Werkzeug's secure password hashing
- **No password storage**: Plain text passwords are never stored
- **Salt-based hashing**: Built-in salt generation for additional security

### 4. Application Security
- **Session management**: Flask-Login provides secure session handling
- **Secret key protection**: Flask secret key loaded from environment variables
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling without information disclosure

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- **Security event logging**: Login attempts and database operations are logged
- **Error logging**: Database and authentication errors are logged for monitoring
- **No sensitive data in logs**: Passwords and secrets are never logged

## Configuration Security

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-unique-secret-key-here
DB_HOST=your-mysql-host
DB_USER=garage_user
DB_PASSWORD=secure-database-password
DB_NAME=garage_app
```

### Optional SSL Configuration
For production deployments, SSL/TLS connections to the database are recommended.
Download CA certificates from your database provider:
- **MySQL on Azure**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/
- **AWS RDS**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html
- **Google Cloud SQL**: https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ssl-instance

```bash
DB_SSL_CA=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
DB_SSL_CERT=/path/to/client-cert.pem
DB_SSL_KEY=/path/to/client-key.pem
```

**Important**: Never commit certificate files to version control. Store them securely and reference their paths in environment variables.

## Database Setup Security

### Recommended MySQL User Setup
```sql
-- Create dedicated user with limited privileges
CREATE USER 'garage_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure-password';

-- Grant only necessary privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON garage_app.* TO 'garage_user'@'localhost';

-- For SSL connections (recommended)
CREATE USER 'garage_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure-password' REQUIRE SSL;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON garage_app.* TO 'garage_user'@'%';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Production Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Generate strong, unique `SECRET_KEY` using: `python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'`
- [ ] Use secure passwords for all accounts (minimum 12 characters)
- [ ] Change default admin username to something unique (not 'admin')
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Set up dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- [ ] Review and restrict network access to database
- [ ] Configure proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Ensure no secrets or certificates are committed to version control

### Network Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS for web application (reverse proxy)
- [ ] Restrict database access to application servers only
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Use VPN or private networks when possible

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up log monitoring for failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor database connection errors
- [ ] Set up alerts for security events
- [ ] Regular security audits

## Code Security Features

### SQL Injection Prevention
All database queries use parameterized statements:
```python
cursor.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND is_active = TRUE",
    (username,)
)
```

### Password Security
```python
# Hashing
password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

# Verification
is_valid = check_password_hash(stored_hash, provided_password)
```

### Environment Variable Usage
```python
# Secure configuration loading
DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
if not DB_PASSWORD:
    raise ValueError("DB_PASSWORD environment variable is required")
```

## Vulnerability Mitigation

| Vulnerability | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|
| SQL Injection | Parameterized queries, input validation |
| Password attacks | Secure hashing with salt, rate limiting recommended |
| Session hijacking | Flask-Login secure sessions, HTTPS recommended |
| Information disclosure | Proper error handling, no sensitive data in logs |
| Man-in-the-middle | SSL/TLS for database and web connections |
| Credential exposure | Environment variables, .gitignore exclusions |

## Security Testing

Use the provided `validate_security.py` script to verify security implementation:
```bash
python validate_security.py
```

This script checks:
- No hardcoded secrets
- Proper environment variable usage
- .gitignore configuration
- Database security implementation
- Password hashing
- SSL/TLS support

## Incident Response

### Failed Login Attempts
- Monitor logs for repeated failed attempts
- Consider implementing rate limiting
- Alert on suspicious patterns

### Database Connection Issues
- Check SSL certificate validity
- Verify network connectivity
- Review database user permissions

### Backup Security
- Encrypt database backups
- Secure backup storage location
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Regular backup verification

## Additional Security Recommendations

### For High-Security Environments
- Implement two-factor authentication
- Add CSRF protection
- Set up intrusion detection
- Regular penetration testing
- Database encryption at rest
- Regular security updates

### Compliance Considerations
- Data retention policies
- Access logging requirements
- Privacy protection measures
- Regular security assessments
